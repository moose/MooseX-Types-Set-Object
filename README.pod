=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a Moose type constraint (see
L<Moose::Util::TypeConstraints>, L<MooseX::Types>).
Note that this constraint and its coercions are B<global>, not simply limited to the scope that
imported it -- in this way it acts like a regular L<Moose> type constraint,
rather than one from L<MooseX::Types>.
